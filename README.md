# Forexbotly
### TODO: This project is a work in progress
Forexbotly is a Python-based bot that uses the IG API to implement a trading strategy for forex markets. The bot uses technical analysis to identify market stages and calculate support and resistance levels for various currency pairs. It also implements three different trading strategies for different market stages.

**Note: the strategies used here are untested, please use at your own risk and manage you money wisely. Backtest every strategy that you implement.**

1. Clone the repository from GitHub using `git clone https://github.com/digiphd/Forexbotly.git`
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Copy the config_sample.ini file and rename it to config.ini.
4. Edit the config.ini file and add your IG account credentials and API key.
5. In the app.py file, update the acc_type and currency_pairs variables to match your trading preferences.
